## NostrLib

Based on NNostr, but I couldn't quite understand how it was meant to be used so I've written a new one.

### Features

- [x] connect
- [x] disconnect
- [x] fetch events of varying filters
- [x] get profiles
- [x] get global posts
- [x] get individual feed
- [x] NIP-04 encrypt/decrypt
- [ ] handle the varying way markdown is packed into profiles

## Thoughts

### Images
- [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/) is how we'll store compact representations of profile images so they load immediately and we can then load them dynamically as they are seen.
